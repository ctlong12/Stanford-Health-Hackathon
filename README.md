# Melli2s: An all-inclusive iOS app for living with Type 2 Diabetes
## 2019 MLH Hackathon at Stanford University

### The Inspiration
Mr. Dave Engberg addressed the need for new solutions to change the current health behaviorâ€™s of Diabetic people and their management of medication, consistent exercise and healthy eating daily. We looked up the current digital solutions for T2D patients and found no existing, all-in-one app for the four main pillars of managing diabetes, which are exercise, glucose control, diet and medication compliance. Therefore, we looked at the different apps and picked the best aspects of those and integrated into one app. We aimed to keep the app simple and easy to use. Furthermore, we developed an idea that would potentially make it easier for T2D patients to eat healthier, not by restricting them to a diet, but by giving them options of home-cooking, delivery of premade foods, and / or creating their own recipe. Our goal is to give the patient flexibility enough for them to feel they have kept their autonomy, yet not to create the paradox of too many choices. This approach also applies to the exercise aspect of the app.
